    <h3>2. Using Dirty Makeup Brushes</h3>
    <p><strong>My Experience:</strong> I rarely cleaned my makeup brushes, not realizing they were full of bacteria. I started noticing breakouts in the same areas where I applied makeup.</p>
    <p><strong>Why It’s Bad:</strong> Dirty brushes transfer bacteria, oil, and old makeup onto your skin, clogging your pores.</p>
    <p><strong>What to Do Instead:</strong> Clean your brushes weekly with a gentle cleanser and let them air dry completely.</p>

    <h3>3. Using Soap and Hair Care Products That Clog Pores</h3>
    <p><strong>My Experience:</strong> I didn’t realize that my shampoo and conditioner were full of oils that dripped onto my face, causing breakouts around my hairline.</p>
    <p><strong>Why It’s Bad:</strong> Hair products with oils or silicones can clog your pores if they come into contact with your skin.</p>
    <p><strong>What to Do Instead:</strong> Look for non-comedogenic hair care products and rinse thoroughly to avoid residue.</p>

    <h3>4. Sleeping in My Makeup</h3>
    <p><strong>My Experience:</strong> After a long day, I used to go to bed without removing my makeup. I woke up with clogged pores and irritated skin.</p>
    <p><strong>Why It’s Bad:</strong> Makeup traps dirt and oil, causing breakouts if left on overnight.</p>
    <p><strong>What to Do Instead:</strong> Always remove your makeup before bed using a gentle cleanser or micellar water.</p>

    <h3>5. Scrubbing My Skin Harshly</h3>
    <p><strong>My Experience:</strong> I thought scrubbing harder would clean my skin better. Instead, I ended up with red, irritated patches.</p>
    <p><strong>Why It’s Bad:</strong> Scrubbing strips your skin of its natural oils, leading to irritation and increased oil production.</p>
    <p><strong>What to Do Instead:</strong> Use a gentle exfoliator once or twice a week and always be gentle with your skin.</p>

    <h3>6. Popping Pimples</h3>
    <p><strong>My Experience:</strong> I couldn’t resist popping my pimples, which led to scars and more inflamed acne.</p>
    <p><strong>Why It’s Bad:</strong> Popping pimples pushes bacteria deeper into your skin, causing infections and scarring.</p>
    <p><strong>What to Do Instead:</strong> Apply a spot treatment with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide and let it heal naturally.</p>
