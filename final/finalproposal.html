        <h2>1. Title and Topic of My Site</h2>
        <p><strong>Title:</strong> Flawlessly You: A Self-Care Guide for Tackling Acne</p>
        <p><strong>Topic:</strong> A website which focuses on supporting individuals with acne-prone skin by exploring its causes, offering effective solutions and habits, and inspiring confidence through self-love and self-care.</p>

        <h2>2. Why I chose this topic</h2>
        <p>
            I struggled with acne throughout my teenage years, and it deeply affected my confidence. During puberty, my face was covered with acne, which led to bullying and ridicule, leaving me feeling ashamed and unable to love myself. I want to create this website because, during my journey, I had no one to guide me, I had to face it alone and find solutions on my own. Through this platform, I hope to empower individuals with acne, reassuring them that they are not alone and that there are solutions to their challenges. Most importantly, I want to share the message of self-love: that even with acne, they are still beautiful. By providing tips, recommending products, and promoting healthy habits, I aim to guide others toward clearer skin and greater confidence.

        <h2>3. Content I will have on the homepage and each of the five pages (one is a table)</h2>
        <p>
            My website will include a Homepage featuring an introduction to the site, along with motivational statements to inspire self-care, love, and confidence. This is where I can also put an introduction to causes of acne. The Lifestyle Habits page will provide practical tips such as changing pillowcases, washing the face, sleeping early, and managing stress to improve skin health. The Eating Diet page will highlight foods that are beneficial or harmful to acne-prone skin and offer guidance on maintaining a skin-friendly diet. The Skincare Products page, which will include a table, will compare different products based on factors like price, ingredients, and benefits for acne-prone skin. The Don'ts page will focus on habits to avoid, such as touching the face or popping pimples, which can aggravate acne. Finally, the Personalized Acne Solution page will include a form where users can input their skin details to receive tailored advice and recommendations.

        <h2>5. How I will collect information/images/content for my site. (2 references I plan on using)</h2>
        <p>
