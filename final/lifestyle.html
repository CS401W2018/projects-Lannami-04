            <p>Good skin isn’t just about products—it’s also about healthy habits. Here are some simple lifestyle changes that can improve your skin:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Change Your Pillowcases Regularly:</strong> Dirty pillowcases can harbor bacteria that contribute to acne.</li>
                <li><strong>Wash Your Face Twice Daily:</strong> Use a gentle cleanser in the morning and at night to remove dirt, oil, and makeup.</li>
                <li><strong>Get Enough Sleep:</strong> Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night to allow your skin to repair itself.</li>
                <li><strong>Manage Stress:</strong> Stress can trigger breakouts, so try relaxation techniques like yoga or meditation.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your skin hydrated and glowing.</li>
            </ul>
