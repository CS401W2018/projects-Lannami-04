        <p>1. What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.</p>
        <p>- Block tags take up the full width of the page, pushing anything after it the next line. It can contain other block or inline elements. Some examples include &lt;div&gt;,&lt;p&gt;,&lt;section&gt;,&lt;h1-h6&gt;. Inline tags on the other hand take up as much width only as necessary. They do not start on a new line. Examples are &lt;span&gt;,&lt;a&gt;,&lt;img&gt;,&lt;strong&gt;.</p>
        <p>2. What is normal flow in HTML?</p>
        <p>- Normal flow is the default layout of the elements on a webpage. It is how browsers behave or arrange its content automatically if there are no specific styles applied.</p>
        <p>3. What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</p>
        <p>- Float allows an element to be positioned to the left or right within its container. It allows other elements to wrap around it. For example, we put the image to the left so the text can flow around it on the right side. We need to clear the float because other elements that we do not want to manipulate may collapse around it. So we need to clear the float to restore the normal flow and assure all elements are following correctly.</p>
        <p>4. What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</p>
        <p>- Absolute positioning removes the element from the normal flow and place it somewhere specific on the stage. It no longer affects the image around it. Fixed positioning sticks an element to a specific spot on the screen. Even if we scroll through our page, it will stay in the same space. Lastly, relative positioning moves an element slightly from where it would normally be. It still takes up space in its original spot.</p>
        <p>5. How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</p>
        <p>- We can use CSS to make responsive design that changes its layout depending on what device we access the webpage on. We can also use media queries to adjust sizing and layout based on the width of the screen.</p>
        <p>6. Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</p>
        <p>- In canvas, each week there is a new topic and always on the first page is learning materials such as video tutorials by our professor.</p>
