            <p>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags.</p>
            <p>Block tags always begin on a new line, and browsers automatically leave a margin (space) before and after the element. These tags always take  the entire width that is available, extending as far to the left and right as possible. Inline tags, on the other hand, do not start with a new line and only take as much space or width that is necessary.</p>    
            <p>What is the margin, border, and padding?</p>  
            <p>Margins are used to create a space around elements and you have full control in setting the margin (top, right, bottom, and left). Border is the outline around an element and lies between the margin and padding. Padding is the space inside the border and the elementâ€™s content. It increases the space inside the element.</p>  
            <p>What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</p>  
            <p>You can use absolute units which are pixels, centimeters, millimeters, inches, points, and picas. There are also relative units which are percent, em, rem, viewport width, and viewport height.</p>  
            <p>When would you use a figure tag?</p>  
            <p>The figure tag is used so that we can group different contents such as images or other media that is usually in the main content. It is mostly accompanied by a figcaption to provide a small explanation for the content.</p>
