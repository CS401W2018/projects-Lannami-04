        <p>How much time should you spend on an engagement assignment after class?</p>
        <p>It is recommended to spend around 30 minutes on an engagement assignment after class. This gives enough time to review the material discussed in class, reinforce understanding, and practice applying what I have learned. This brief but focused time will help solidify concepts while keeping the workload manageable.</p>
        <p>What should you focus on during class and after class?</p>
        <p>During class, the main focus should be on understanding the lesson being taught and staying engaged with the material presented by the instructor. Take notes, ask questions, and actively participate to ensure the key concepts are understood. After class, the focus should be shifted to applying what I have learned, whether that's working on assignments like HTML project or exploring the material further through hands-on practice. This helps reinforce what I have learned earlier and apply it in real-life.</p>
        <p>What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</p>
        <p>CSS Grid is used for creating two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns), while CSS Flex is mainly for one-dimensional layouts (either a row or a column).</p>
