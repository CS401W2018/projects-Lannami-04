        <h2>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</h2>
        <p>Inline CSS has the style attribute inside the HTML element. The style is applied only to the elements within the tag.</p>
        <p>Embedded CSS has the style elemend inside the head section of the HTML document. The CSS rules are inside the style block.</p>
        <p>External CSS uses a separate .css file that is linked to the HTML document using a link tag that is inside the head section.</p>
        <h2>Explain why you should only use external CSS.</h2>
        <p>Using an external CSS helps us to separate our HTML content from its styling, making the code much easier to read and organize. It also allows multiple HTML files to be linked to the external css file which makes our work more efficient if we are creating many pages. Most importantly, external CSS improves website performance because it does not need to download the CSS over and over when a user visits another page on the same website as the file is already cached. </p>
        <h2>What is a selector used for?</h2>
        <p>The selector is used for targeting and selecting the HTML elements that we want to style. After it identifies the HTML element, we can then apply various styles such as color, font size, and more.</p>
