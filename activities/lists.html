        <li> <strong>What is the BEST way to make sure you get a good grade on the projects?</strong></li>
        <p><u>The best way to have good grades on the projects are to complete each one of them independently and on time, as late submissions are not accepted. However, if you need to improve your scores on the projects, you have the opportunity to resubmit up to four projects within one week of their original due dates.</u></p>
        <li><strong>When is your project due?</strong></li>
        <p> <u>The project is due on Monday at 11:59 pm.</u></p>
        <li><strong>What are special entity characters?</strong></li>
        <p> <u>Special entity characters are specific symbols used to represent characters that already has a reserved meaning in HTML. These are used to ensure that symbols like &lt;,&gt;, &amp;, and others are correctly displayed on a webpage rather than being interpreted as part of the HTML code.  </u></p>
        <li><strong>What is the difference between OL and UL Tags?</strong></li>
        <p> <u>The difference of OL and UL tags lies in how they display lists. OL tags create an ordered list where each item is numbered or lettered sequentially. The default styling is a numbered list but you can also use letters or Roman numerals. On the other hand, UL tags creates an unordered list. Each item is marked with a bullet point as the items do not have an inherent order. You can also change the style from circles to squares.</u></p>
