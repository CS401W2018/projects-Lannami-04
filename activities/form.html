    <p>1. What are different ways to style your form?</p>
    <p>To style my form, I’d use different CSS properties to make it look more organized and visually appealing. I can change things like the background-color, border, and font-size to make the form easier to read. Adding padding and margins is also helpful because it spaces out the elements, so they don’t look all cramped together. One important thing our professor mentioned was to make the input boxes aligned to one another. This helps to make the form more coherent and makes it appear more professional, hence, trustworthy. I’d also try adjusting the font and color to make it more attractive and maybe even add rounded borders with border-radius or a shadow effect to give it a 3D look. Finally, our professor said it is also important that my form can also be user-friendly for mobile users. This makes it more responsive and I can do that by using CSS grid or flex.

    <p>2. Why does the professor like to use flex?</p>
    <p>The professor likes to use flex because it’s a flexible and efficient way to arrange elements on a page, especially for layouts that need to adapt to different screen sizes. It is more adaptable in a way that it can automatically adjust the size of items based on available space, preventing overflow issues that might happen with Grid. With Flexbox, items can wrap, shrink, or grow within a container to fit the screen size, so we don’t have to worry as much about things spilling out of the layout.</p>
