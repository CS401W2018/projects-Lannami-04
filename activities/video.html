    1. What are the positives and negatives of hosting your videos on YouTube?
    </p>
    <p>
        Hosting videos on YouTube is great because it is free to use, easy to embed on websites, and reaches a global audience. It also improves visibility since YouTube videos can rank on Google. However, the platform compresses video quality, and ads or recommended videos can distract viewers.

    2. What is the most useful thing you can do with a transform?
    </p>
    <p>
        The most useful thing we can do with a transform is make our website more dynamic and visually interesting. For example, we can use it to scale, rotate, or move elements without affecting the overall layout. It’s helpful for creating smooth animations and enhancing user experience. Transformations are also great for responsive design, like adjusting elements for smaller screens.

    3. How do you stay safe online?
    </p>
    <p>
        To stay safe online, I use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. I avoid clicking on suspicious links and only share personal information on trusted sites. Keeping my software updated helps protect against vulnerabilities. I also use a VPN on public Wi-Fi to secure my connection.
