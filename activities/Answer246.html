   <h1>My answer to 2, 4, and 6</h1>
   <h2>2. Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h2>
   <p>Absolute and relative link are used to link web pages. Absolute links are used for both internal and external linking. It can be your own website or other, while relative links are best for navigating within your own site. </p>
   <h2>4. List the 3 rules with relative links.</h2>
   <p>1.Dot = current folder: The single dot represents the current directory or folder where the file is located. 
   <p>2. Double dot = parent folder: This indicates that you have to go up one level in the directory to the parent folder.</p>
   <p>3. Slash at beginning = start at the root: This means that the path starts from the root directory of the website. The link will look for the file from the very top level.</p>
   <h2>6. Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h2>
   <p>No, links do not always need to be inside a nav tag.</p>
