        <h3>1. What you learned about Flex and CSS.</h3>
        <p>Flexbox is a tool we can use to easily arrange and align things on a web page. When we set display: flex on a container, all the items inside it line up in a row or column depending on how we set it. We can modify the spacing between the items using justify-content and flex-flow: row wrap to line up items in rows that wrap onto the next line if they do not fit. The gap: 10px makes space between the items so they do not look like they are crowded. All of these makes our webpage look more organized and responsive. </p>
        <h3>2. Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?</h3>
        <p>Having an accessible website means making our design user-friendly to everyone, including people with disabilities. This includes making sure it works well for people who rely on screen readers, have vision or hearing impairments, or have limited mobility. Accessibility is important because it ensures that all users can navigate, understand, and interact with the website, regardless of their abilities. It also helps websites meet legal standards and reach a wider audience, providing a better user experience for everyone.</p>
