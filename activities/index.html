        <p>PNG uses lossless compression, meaning that the image quality is preserved without losing any data, which is ideal for images that require high quality, such as graphics and text. It also allows varying levels of transparency.</p>
        <p>4. How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</p>
