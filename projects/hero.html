        <p>Hayao Miyazaki co-founded Studio Ghibli in 1985 with the purpose of creating animated films which transcend traditional storytelling. His works reflect his deep appreciation for nature, childhood memories, and Japanese folklore. His films evoke human emotions in a unique way which blends fantasy, allowing the audience to feel like they are transported into a magical world filled with adventure and learning. His works tackle societal issues and universal truths. His purpose has always been to evoke a sense of wonder, encouraging viewers to reconnect with their childish and innocent self while also appreciating the beauty of the simpleness of life. His interests are also reflected in the films he creates. His passion for aviation is truly felt in his films such as Porco Rosso and The Wind Rises. This showcases not only his passion but also symbolize freedom and escape, which are themes usually emphasized in Studio Ghibli Films. Miyazaki’s films, at their core, invite viewers to soar beyond the ordinary, all while being grounded in values of love, compassion, and environmental respect.</p>
