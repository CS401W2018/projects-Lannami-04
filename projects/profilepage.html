    <h1>Aloha! My name is Lanna Mae Eleazar</h1>
    <p>I am a Computer Science major at BYU-Hawaii. Originally from the <strong>Philippines,</strong> I am the youngest of three siblings. Before coming here, I spent a year studying Nursing in my home country. At first, I was uncertain if this move was the right decision, as I felt I had lost valuable time. However, upon arriving in Hawaii, <mark>I quickly realized it was the best choice I have ever made.</mark> The vibrant campus, with its beautiful scenery and numerous study areas, creates an environment that encourages learning and personal growth. Being here has helped me grow spiritually, given that BYU-Hawaii is a church education school, and has made my 20s a time of significant personal development. </p>
    <p> Outside of my academic pursuits, I love spending time at the beach, especially having picnics with friends whenever I need to unwind. I am currently learning how to play the piano and I also plan to learn the ukelele in the future. I have a passion for anime, with a special fondness for Studio Ghibli's works. My favorite is <em>Howl's Moving Castle.</em> My interest in Japanese culture extends to music, as I enjoy listening to Japanese and occasionally Korean songs. In my free time, I also indulge in online gaming, particularly games like <em>Teamfight Tactics</em> and <em>League of Legends</em>. If I was given an opportunity to travel the world, I would love to travel <strong>Japan, Italy, and France.</strong> These places have been in my bucket list for so long and I cannot wait for the time to come to experience the beauty of these places. Being in Hawaii has offered me the perfect balance of study, work, and leisure, making this chapter of my life incredibly fulfilling.</p>
