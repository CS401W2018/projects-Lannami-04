        <p> <strong>Why I love Studio Ghibli Films</strong></p>
        <p>
            My heart has always had a place for Studio Ghibli films. The very first one that I watched was <em>Spirited Away</em>, which left a lasting impact on my heart. As a child, I was mesmerized by its fantastical world and unique storyline, where the protagonist, Chihiro, journeys into a mysterious spirit realm to save her parents who were turned into pigs by an evil witch. I know, it may sound childish, but for me, it was an immersive adventure. I felt like I was traveling alongside Chihiro, feeling every emotion such as fear, bravery, happiness, and kindness. The animation, the enchanting soundtrack, and the magical places intertwined so beautifully that even now, as an adult, it brings me comfort. Rewatching <em>Spirited Away</em> is like returning to a familiar embrace. I feel connected with Chihiro’s experience of being alone in an unfamiliar world yet finding a sense of family and belonging. It mirrors my own journey here in Hawaii, where I left home, ventured into the unknown, and slowly began to discover my home, new people, and parts of myself that I didn't know existed. Much like Chihiro, I feel like I am on an adventure, growing and learning from each step I take.

            Beyond <em>Spirited Away</em>, every Studio Ghibli film holds a special place in my heart. From the love story of <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em>, where two seemingly mismatched individuals help each other heal and create a home, to the delicate, coming-of-age journeys in <em>Kiki’s Delivery Service</em> and <em>The Secret World of Arrietty</em>, which explore themes like loneliness, independence, and the bittersweet process of growing up. These films gently touch on life’s quiet struggles, wrapping them in beautifully animated worlds filled with wonder and nostalgia. I love the themes of war and peace in <em>Porco Rosso</em> and <em>The Wind Rises</em>, where Miyazaki’s love for aviation comes through so vividly. What I find most profound is how these films remind me to slow down and appreciate the beauty of life. It returns me to an innocent and carefree state. When I watch Studio Ghibli films, I feel grounded, as if all of life’s troubles are small. I am reminded to reconnect with nature and embrace the simplicity of being present. In essence, Studio Ghibli films are not just animated stories for me, they are a comforting escape and a reminder that life is a journey and it is okay to lose ourselves sometimes because we will eventually find our way home.

        <p><strong>About Links</strong></p>
        <p>
            A relative link is used when you want to link one file to another. Instead of specifying the full path of a file or resource, it gives directions based on where the current file is located. It only contains the location following the domain because it assumes that the link that you add is part of the same root domain. On the other hand, absolute link specifies the full path to a file or resource. It starts from the root directory or it includes the complete URL. It is independent of the location of the file containing the link.
