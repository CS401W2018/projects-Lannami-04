    <h2>Internet</h2>
    <p>The Internet is a massive network that connects computers all around the world. It allows computers to communicate and share information to each other.</p>
    <h2>Web</h2>
    <p>The Web is a system of interlinked documents that we can access through the internet using web browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Edge and Safari. This is what we use to browse websites and was created to allow users to easily access and share information.
    </p>
    <h2>How are the Internet and Web different?</h2>
    <p>The Internet is like an underlying infrastructure that supports the Web. It consists of servers, routers, and cables that allow data to travel between computers. On the other hand, the Web is a service that runs on the Internet and allows people to access and share information.
    </p>
    <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
    <p>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard that represents text in computers. It assigns a unique code to represent a character. It allows 128 possible characters that include English letters, numbers, and basic punctuation. On the other hand, Unicode is like an expanded version of ASCII because it addresses the limitations set by ASCII. Unicode can accommodate different languages, symbols, and even emojis that ASCII cannot represent.</p>
    <h2>What is UTF-8</h2>
    <p>UTF-8 (8-bit Unicode Transformation Format) is a widely used encoding system for Unicode characters. It supports a wide range of characters from different languages. It uses one to four bytes to represent each character which makes it more efficient and flexible in handling complex characters. 
    </p>
    <h2>URL</h2>
    <p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is the address we type into our browser to access a specific website or page. It locates a specific page by knowing the protocol, domain, and path. For example, https://www.hello.com is a URL. These are essential for navigating content online.</p>
    <h2>Domain Name</h2>
    <p>The Domain name is the human-readable part of a URL. Like from our example earlier, hello.com is the Domain name which is much easier to recognize. </p>
    <h2>HTTP</h2>
    <p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol that is utilized to send data across the Internet. It specifies the format and message transmission.
    </p>
    <h2>HTTPS</h2>
    <p>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is similar to HTTP but has more security. It makes the website safer to use by encrypting data transferred between your browser and the website.
    </p>
    <h2>IP Address</h2>
    <p>IP Address stands for Internet Protocol Address. It is a unique set of numbers assigned to each device on the Internet. Its purpose is to identify the device and locate it on the network. It is like a home address for our computer so other computers know where to send data.
    </p>
    <h2>DNS</h2>
    <p>DNS (Domain System Name) functions similarly to a phone book. DNS converts a domain name into a corresponding IP address so that our browser can connect to the appropriate web server and retrieve the desired content.</p>
    <h2>W3C Recommendations</h2>
    <p>These are guidelines and rules set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to make sure that web technologies complement one another and that it is consistent and accessible. They contribute to a more user-friendly Web experience.
    </p>
    <h2>XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
    <p>XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a way to structure data using tags. It is not specifically for web pages but for storing and transporting data. XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) is a stricter version of HTML that follows XML rules. It is used to create web pages with more consistency. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It uses tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, and links. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. It includes new features and improvements, like better support for multimedia (videos and audio) and new elements for structuring web pages.</p>
